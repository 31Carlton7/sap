## Developer Info

The API for getting the music and other information are courtesy of [Deezer](https://developers.deezer.com/).
To build the app I utilized the [Flutter SDK](https://flutter.dev) as the UI Framework and that uses [Dartlang](https://dart.dev) as the programming language. The list of packages the app uses can be found [here](https://github.com/31Carlton7/sap/blob/master/pubspec.yaml) under the `dependencies` indent. My UI Package I use to curate the UI can be found [here](https://github.com/31Carlton7/canton_design_system), however I will not be publishing the package on [pub.dev](pub.dev) anytime soon. This project is null safe. I also used Firebase Analytics and Crashlytics to better understand the users who use the app. There is no form of authentication or database usage.

## FAQ

<details>
<summary>Why are all the songs only 30 seconds long?</summary>
Sap plays the preview of every song rather than the actual song. The Deezer API does not provide the actual song link.

<details>
<summary>Can I load my own music?</summary>
No.

<details>
<summary> Why did you name it Sap?</summary>
Special thanks to my sister, she gave me the idea to name the app "Sap".
